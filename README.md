# BMLP-KS-Perempuan-Jabar
This project is the final assignment from my learning journey in the "Belajar Machine Learning Pemula" course by Dicoding. In this project, I analyzed a dataset on violence against women in West Java Province, categorized by types of violence and regions (districts/cities), from 2017 to 2024.
